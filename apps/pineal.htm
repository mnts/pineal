        <h3>Power</h3>
        <article>
          At MESS we are proud of our audience's diversity and range of ages and backgrounds.
          Come for the food, drinks and music but also for the people. Bump elbows with a new pal!

        <h3>Value</h3>
        <article>
          A MESS membership gets you tickets to 4-6 events with world-class music,
          gourmet morsels and craft cocktails for you and a friend,
          depending on your membership level.
          That works out to as little as $25 per event -
          cheaper than a regular night out at AMC or Lincoln Center.
          And you'll get a lot better than battling superheroes and a lot closer than the Family Circle.
          You will experience inspired world-class artists at the top of their game,
          doing their thing while you're close enough to see how it works and feel the craftsmanship.
          Like no other experience in NYC.

        <h3>Exclusivity</h3>
        <article>
          MESS is all about the irreplaceable experience of intimacy with art.
          So we have a strictly limited number of memberships available to preserve
          our audience's closeness to what we offer.
          Our concert events are one night only and have limited capacity.
          If you want in, this is how! Members also receive exclusive advanced access
          to tickets for our Premier productions (starting in Fall 2018).
          If you like our special events, you ain't seen nothing yet!

        <h3>Peace of mind</h3>
        <article>
          As a MESS member you can also be proud to support a sustainable company
          that was developed by artists and provides a living wage to musicians in New York City.
          We also provide a platform for brilliant young artists
          to gain a foothold in the artistic capital of the world.
          And MESS is an institution that reinvests its resources in the future of music
          and music appreciation in the community. Ultimately,
          you are helping the classical arts survive and thrive in the 21st-century.
